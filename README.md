1. Pairplot Observation:
The pairplot shows that passengers who survived tend to be clustered at lower ages and higher fares. Additionally, there is a noticeable separation between classes, with first-class passengers (high fares) more likely to survive.

2. Heatmap Observation:
The correlation heatmap indicates a strong negative correlation between Pclass and Fare (higher class, higher fare). There is also a slight positive correlation between Fare and Survived.

3. Histogram Observation:
The Age histogram shows that most passengers were between 20-40 years old, with fewer elderly passengers. There is a spike in children under 10.

4. Boxplot (Age vs Survival):
The boxplot reveals that survivors had a lower median age than non-survivors, indicating younger passengers were more likely to survive.

5. Boxplot (Fare vs Survival):
Passengers who survived paid higher fares on average, and there are many outliers of very high fares among survivors, suggesting wealthy passengers had better access to lifeboats.

6. Scatterplot (Age vs Fare):
The scatterplot shows that younger passengers with higher fares had the highest survival rates, indicating that younger, wealthier individuals were prioritized.

Summary of Findings:
Summary of Findings:

Survival was highly influenced by gender: Females had a significantly higher survival rate than males.

Younger passengers (especially children) were more likely to survive compared to older individuals.

Fare and Class played a major role: passengers who paid higher fares and traveled in first class were much more likely to survive.

There is a noticeable correlation between Pclass and Fare, with first-class passengers paying significantly more.

Most passengers were from lower classes (Pclass = 3), which had the lowest survival rate.

These findings suggest that survival was biased towards wealthy, younger individuals, and females, reflecting social and economic inequalities during the Titanic disaster.
